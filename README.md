# MarsAir

MarsAir is a commercial spaceship operator that sells trips to the Red Planet. This application is the first website created by MarsAir to sell tickets for their trips. The UI is designed to be attractive and effective, with no bells and whistles. The application should look relatively similar across all commonly used browsers in use today.
